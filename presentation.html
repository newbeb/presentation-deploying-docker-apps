# Why are we here?

![Docker Whale](https://d3oypxn00j2a10.cloudfront.net/0.9.0/img/homepage/docker-whale-home-logo.png "The new application deployment hotness.")

???

Why?
* Docker is the "new hotness" in application management.
* Learn about what Docker is, and some ways that apps can be deployed in it today (and tomorrow). 
 * Not a deep dive into all of Docker, just give you a taste.
* Talk about where Docker is going
 * What will be the role is in the IaaS & PaaS workspace
* How many people have
 * Heard about Docker?
 * Played with Docker?
 * Use Docker today in their work/play?

# Roadmap:

* What is Docker?
* A Mental Model (Show Me!)
* Escaping one host
* Using Docker today

name: whatisdocker

# What is Docker?

## Engine for deployment of applications
 * Client & Server
 * [APIs](http://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/ "Docker REST API")
 * [Command Line Interface](http://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/ "Docker CLI")
 * [Registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/ "Common Registry for Docker Images") for management and sharing of "images"

--

## "virtualized" execution environment
 * Image format &amp; Filesystem Abstraction
 * Linux Containers

???

* Achieve many of the same goals as Virtualization
 * without the overhead/cost
 * with more risk?
* Lots of tooling written in Go

---

# Docker Container Pieces



.left-column[
* Execution Driver
 * libcontainer
 * LXC
 * ...
* Linux CGroups
* Kernel Namespaces
* Image
]
.right-column[
![Shipping Containers](http://photos.adron.me/Software/Software-Development/Docker-Virtual-Machines/i-jT3FfMR/0/S/photodune-1719153-container-l-S.jpg "Consistent API for Shipping Code")
]

???
* Not Virtualization
 * VMWare is very interested/involved in the community
 * Many times containers are run in VMs to achieve higher isolation (w/ some cost)
* CGroups
 * Kernel Level
 * Groups processes
 * Controls resource allocations: CPU, Memory, Network, Disk
 * Can be layered/nested
* Kernel Namespaces
 * Control what you can do
 * Restrict the "view" of the system
 * Docker has defaults
 * Can be layered/nested
* Docker Image
 * A package of "tarballs"
 * Can be hierarchical
 * Ends up being built as a layered - copy on write filesystem

* Linux containers and CGroups have [been in the linux kernel since 2007] (http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-history-of-control-groups-and-Linux-Containers-in-the-Linux-kernel).
* FreeBSD Jails have been [since 4.x](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html#jails-synopsis) ([2000-2005](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_FreeBSD#FreeBSD_4))

# Docker Filesystem

![Multiple Containers running in Docker](http://docs.docker.com/terms/images/docker-filesystems-busyboxrw.png)

???

* BootFS
* Layer on Images
* Writable container on top (copy on write)


---

# A Mental Model (Show Me)

* One container
* Docker CLI - Crash Course
* Multiple Containers - Volumes
* Multiple Containers - Linking
* Multiple Containers example w/ Fig

---
name: docker_hello_world

# One Container - Running a shell in Docker

```sh
# Run bash on ubuntu  (-i interactive -t tty)
* $ docker run -i -t -rm ubuntu /bin/bash
```

#### Wait for it to build... (the first time)

docker run -i -t --rm ubuntu /bin/bash
echo hostname
ps
uname -a

* --rm means throw the container away when we exit.

name: crash_using_images

# Crash Course - Using Images

Pre-built images that you can use to run

Images are conceptually "tarballs" that contain the "layers" that will make up the container.

## Commands:
* docker images
* docker pull [imagename]
* docker search [imagename]

???
Search looks at the registry and finds stuff.

---
name: crash_registries
# Crash Course - Registries

Registries manage images. They can be widely shared, or closely held.

* Public registry
 * [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/) 
* private registry
 * [Run your own in Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry)
 * [Quay](https://quay.io/)
* docker login

???
docker run -p 5000:5000 registry

No Demo of registries (for now)

---
name: crash_building_images

# Crash Course - Building Images

* Manually
 * Start an image w/ bash
 * Run commands
  * Maybe use salt, ansible, chef, puppet, ...
 * docker commit

* Dockerfile
 * The way (we are going) to do it...

???

Building images is similar to the concept in Vagrant.

# Crash Course - Running our new Image

docker run [imagespec] [args]

```sh
* $ docker run bln_centos_jvm
java version "1.8.0_11"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_11-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.11-b03, mixed mode)
```

**How do we run a class or a jarfile?**

???

docker run bln_centos_jvm -help

Doesn't really do anything, but it is a great **BASE IMAGE** for JVMs

---
name: springboot
class: middle, center

# Requisite Spring Boot Application... 
## (plus Docker)

java -jar something.jar

---

# Dockerfile for executable jar

```sh
FROM bln_centos_jvm
MAINTAINER Brian Lloyd-Newberry <newbeb@gmail.com>

ADD build/libs/docker-pixel-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /opt/jars/

CMD ["-jar", "/opt/jars/docker-pixel-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]
```

--
### Build and run the image
```sh
docker build -t bln_java_pixel .
docker run -p 8888:8080 bln_java_pixel
```
--
### Build and run the image in the background
```sh
docker run -p 8888:8080 -d bln_java_pixel
docker logs -ft bln_java_pixel
```

---

# To include

* Naming containers: docker run --name somenameofcontainer .....
* Attach to container  docker attach [name|id]
* Detached containers: -d
** Has to have something to keep running
* Docker logs: docker logs [-f] [-t] [name|id]
** follow, timestamp
* Looking inside container: docker top [name|id]
* docker start|stop|rm [name|id]
* docker inspect [name|id]
* docker run [--rm]
** --rm creates a container but doesn't save it

# Building an application and running it in Docker

Build and tag our pixel server

gradle build

Look at docker file

docker build -t bln_java_pixel .

Run it

docker run -p 8080:8080 -d bln_java_pixel

docker ps

http://192.168.59.103:8080/

???

1. Build our app
gradle build

2. Define a Docker file and build it
docker build -t bln_java_pixel .

3. Run our Docker image
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d bln_java_pixel

4. See what Docker is running
docker ps

5. Hit our service
http://192.168.59.103:8080/


* The docker file is linked. It depends on bln_centos_jvm. 
* Note that all we provide is the ADD and the CMD.
* We could use volumes for the jar as well

---


---

* Escaping one host
 * Kubernetes
 * Mesos/Marathon
 * CoreOS...
 * OpenStack, ...

---

* Using Docker Today
 * Moving extremely quickly, lots of innovation and churn
 * https://devopsu.com/blog/docker-misconceptions/
 * Local and Dev environments
  * Do lots of the same things that vagrant does w/ chef,puppet,salt
  * You can't deploy vagrant images (sortof)
