# Why are we here?

![Docker Whale](https://d3oypxn00j2a10.cloudfront.net/0.9.0/img/homepage/docker-whale-home-logo.png "The new application deployment hotness.")

???

Why?
* Docker is the "new hotness" in application management.
* Learn about what Docker is, and some ways that apps can be deployed in it today (and tomorrow). 
 * Not a deep dive into all of Docker, just give you a taste.
* Talk about where Docker is going
 * What will be the role is in the IaaS & PaaS workspace
* How many people have
 * Heard about Docker?
 * Played with Docker?
 * Use Docker today in their work/play?

---

# Roadmap:

* What is Docker
 * Containers vs VMs
 * Docker quick hit
 * What makes up Docker

* Examples
 * One container
 * Multiple Containers - Volumes
 * Multiple Containers - Linking
 * Multiple Containers example w/ Fig (and by hand)

* Docker - Spanning Hosts
 * Kubernetes
 * Mesos/Marathon
 * CoreOS...
 * OpenStack, ...

* Using Docker Today
 * Moving extremely quickly, lots of innovation and churn
 * https://devopsu.com/blog/docker-misconceptions/
 * Local and Dev environments
  * Do lots of the same things that vagrant does w/ chef,puppet,salt
  * You can't deploy vagrant images (sortof)

Discuss - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

---

# What is Docker?

* Engine for deployment of applications
 * Client & Server
 * [APIs](http://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/ "Docker REST API")
 * [Command Line Interface](http://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/ "Docker CLI")
 * [Registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/ "Common Registry for Docker Images") for management and sharing of "images"

--

* "Virtualized" execution environment
 * Image format &amp; Filesystem Abstraction
 * Linux Containers

???

* You can also run your own registry easily (using Docker!)
* Lots of tooling written in Go

# Docker Container Pieces

![Shipping Containers](http://photos.adron.me/Software/Software-Development/Docker-Virtual-Machines/i-jT3FfMR/0/S/photodune-1719153-container-l-S.jpg "Consistent API for Shipping Code")


* Execution Driver(s) - libcontainer/LXC/...
* Linux CGroups
* Kernel Namespaces
* Image

???
* Not Virtualization
 * VMWare is very interested/involved in the community
 * Many times containers are run in VMs to achieve higher isolation (w/ some cost)
* CGroups
 * Kernel Level
 * Groups processes
 * Controls resource allocations: CPU, Memory, Network, Disk
 * Can be layered/nested
* Kernel Namespaces
 * Control what you can do
 * Restrict the "view" of the system
 * Docker has defaults
 * Can be layered/nested
* Docker Image
 * A package of "tarballs"
 * Can be hierarchical
 * Ends up being built as a layered - copy on write filesystem

* Linux containers and CGroups have [been in the linux kernel since 2007] (http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-history-of-control-groups-and-Linux-Containers-in-the-Linux-kernel).
* FreeBSD Jails have been [since 4.x](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html#jails-synopsis) ([2000-2005](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_FreeBSD#FreeBSD_4))

# Docker Filesystem

![Multiple Containers running in Docker](http://docs.docker.com/terms/images/docker-filesystems-busyboxrw.png)

???

* BootFS
* Layer on Images
* Writable container on top (copy on write)

---

# Running a shell in Docker

# Run bash on ubuntu  (-i interactive -t tty)
$ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash

# To include

* Naming containers: docker run --name somenameofcontainer .....
* Attach to container  docker attach [name|id]
* Detached containers: -d
** Has to have something to keep running
* Docker logs: docker logs [-f] [-t] [name|id]
** follow, timestamp
* Looking inside container: docker top [name|id]
* docker start|stop|rm [name|id]
* docker inspect [name|id]
* docker run [--rm]
** --rm creates a container but doesn't save it

# Building an application and running it in Docker

Build and tag our pixel server

gradle build

Look at docker file

docker build -t bln_java_pixel .

Run it

docker run -p 8080:8080 -d bln_java_pixel

docker ps

http://192.168.59.103:8080/

???

1. Build our app
gradle build

2. Define a Docker file and build it
docker build -t bln_java_pixel .

3. Run our Docker image
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d bln_java_pixel

4. See what Docker is running
docker ps

5. Hit our service
http://192.168.59.103:8080/


* The docker file is linked. It depends on bln_centos_jvm. 
* Note that all we provide is the ADD and the CMD.
* We could use volumes for the jar as well
